# Vault Manager Skill

Manage files and structure in the AI Employee Obsidian vault.

## Vault Location

The vault is at: `D:/hackathon-0-PersonalAI-Employee/AI_Employee_Vault`

## Vault Structure

```

```

## Available Operations

### 1. Create a Plan
When asked to plan a task, create a plan file:

```markdown
# AI_Employee_Vault/Plans/PLAN_[description]_[date].md
---
created: [ISO timestamp]
status: pending
task: [brief description]
---

## Objective
[What needs to be accomplished]

## Steps
- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
- [ ] Step 3

## Dependencies
[What's needed before execution]

## Approval Required
[Yes/No — if yes, an approval file will be created]
```

### 2. Check Approvals
Scan `/Pending_Approval` for items and report their status:
```
Glob: AI_Employee_Vault/Pending_Approval/*.md
```

Scan `/Approved` for newly approved items ready for execution:
```
Glob: AI_Employee_Vault/Approved/*.md
```

### 3. Archive to Done
Move completed files from any folder to `/Done`:
```bash
mv "AI_Employee_Vault/[source]/[file]" "AI_Employee_Vault/Done/"
```

### 4. Create a Log Entry
Append to the daily log file `AI_Employee_Vault/Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json`:

```json
{"timestamp": "[ISO]", "action_type": "[type]", "actor": "claude_code", "details": "[what happened]", "result": "success"}
```

### 5. Create a Briefing
Generate a summary report in `/Briefings/`:

```markdown
# AI_Employee_Vault/Briefings/YYYY-MM-DD_[title].md
---
generated: [ISO timestamp]
period: [date range]
---

# [Title]

## Summary
[Overview]

## Details
[Specifics]

---
*Generated by AI Employee v0.1*
```

### 6. Process Approved Items
When files appear in `/Approved`:
1. Read the approval file
2. Execute the approved action
3. Log the execution
4. Move the file to `/Done`

## Rules
- Always follow `Company_Handbook.md` permission boundaries
- Never delete files — always move to `/Done` for audit trail
- Log every file operation
- When creating files, use descriptive names with dates
- Keep the vault organized — no files in the root except Dashboard and Handbook

## Output
After any operation, report what was done and suggest running `/update-dashboard` to refresh the dashboard.
